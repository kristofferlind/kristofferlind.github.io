I'm Kristoffer Lind, a swedish software engineer and site reliability engineer. I currently work at the Lund branch of [tretton37](https://tretton37.com). I've been curious about technology all my life and in the business since 2009.

# Too much information
I was a sergeant and systems technician for communication systems in the military. Following that I was in the family business for a couple of years, working as a stonemason doing mostly kitchen countertops in granite. I've also failed at running a company, we charged too little and had only dull projects that focused mostly on design (which I suck at).

I have a wife and three kids. We have a house we're renovating (including networking, electrical wiring and layout changes). Other projects include: a bunch of software projects, this blog, 3D modeling and woodworking projects. In between those there's also snowboarding, inline skating, mountainbiking, music (most recent discovery being hitech, oxidaksi - poison turtle is awesome, thanks B1nke) and hiking.
